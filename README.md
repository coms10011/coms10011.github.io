## COMS10011 Probability and Statistics

This is the second time this unit has been taught; it will be
substantially the same as last year, since last year we, as in the CS,
department, has implemented a revision week, this means that there
will be two fewer lectures delivering new material and so the amount
of material will be reduced by a very small amount.

The lectures for this unit are Conor Houghton and Anne Roudaut.

#### Textbooks

The probability part of the unit is based in part on

*William Mendenhall, Dennis D Wackerly and Richard L Scheaffer. Mathematical Statistics with Applications
